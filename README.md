# Weather Dashboard

This app allows the user to search for any city to see the current and future weather conditions for up to five days. This app uses Open Weather API: https://openweathermap.org/api. The search will display the current date, an icon, temperature, humidity, wind speed and color coded UV index. Local storage is also being used to save the users last search. When the app is refreshed, any search the user has made will still be available in the previous search section.
  
I had previously submitted this assignment with completed HTML and CSS but had been unable to do anything further than write some Javascript to insert the time and insert some icons using links from Open Weather. I have been able to revisit this assignment and make the following additions so that the app now complies with the homework requirements:

- Use moment.js instead of manually writing time function in Javascript
- Combine bootstrap and jQuery to create and append elements
- Connect Open Weather API to my app to display weather for city
- Set up local storage to save past searches in the previous search section
