- Search bar to allow user to search for a city
- When search is done user is presented with current and future conditions for that city and it is added to the search history
- When the current weather conditions are viewed the name of the city, the date, an icon (sun, rain), the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed and the UV index are shown
- When the UV index is viewed the user is presented with a colour that indicates whether the conditions are favourable, moderaete or severe
- The future weather conditions will be shown with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon, the temperature, the wind speed and the humidity 
- The search history contains working links back to all previous searches  


For this assignment, I have completed the HTML and CSS, have been able to write some Javascript to insert the time and have connected to the API icons. I have had trouble connecting to the API to access the weather data and have watched multiple videos to attempt to do this with no luck. I am going to continue researching and will come back to this when I have more information.
